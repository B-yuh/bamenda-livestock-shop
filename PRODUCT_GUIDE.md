# How to Add/Edit Products (No Coding Required!)

## Adding New Products

1. **Open the file `script.js`** in any text editor (Notepad, WordPad, etc.)

2. **Find the products section** (around line 50-100, look for `const products = [`)

3. **Copy this template and paste it in the products list:**
```javascript
{
    id: "new-product-id",
    name: "Product Name",
    price: 5000,
    category: "poultry", // or "other-animals", "accessories", "feed"
    image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...", // or leave empty for default
    description: "Product description here",
    seller: "Your Name",
    location: "Bamenda",
    pickupLocations: ["Location 1", "Location 2"],
    inStock: true
},
```

4. **Save the file and upload to Netlify** (I'll show you how)

## Example Product Entry:
```javascript
{
    id: "broiler-chicken-1",
    name: "Broiler Chicken - 2kg",
    price: 8000,
    category: "poultry",
    image: "",
    description: "Fresh broiler chicken, ready for cooking",
    seller: "Bamenda Poultry Farm",
    location: "Bamenda",
    pickupLocations: ["Bamenda Market", "Farm Gate"],
    inStock: true
},
```
